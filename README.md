This is my second [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!  

features all the guided implementations: a moving player that can shoot asteroids which will split if they are a certain size and if he collides with a asteroid, the game is over.  
i have added the following on top:
- Scoring system (time, asteroids shot)
- Multiple lives with respawning and a 1sec invulnerability to not get spawncamped
- Explosion effect when destroying asteroids
